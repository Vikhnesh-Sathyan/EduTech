        <p>
          Scales and intervals are fundamental to understanding the relationships between notes in music. You will learn about major and minor scales, how they are constructed, and the role intervals play in creating melodies and harmonies.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to learning theory, you will practice using scales and intervals to compose original pieces and to analyze famous works from various composers.</p>

      <div [hidden]="!topics['topic4']" class="topic-details">
        <p>
          Chords are created by combining multiple notes, and harmony occurs when these chords support the melody. This topic will teach you how to construct chords, understand chord progressions, and analyze harmonic structures.
        </p>
        <p>Through exercises and case studies, you'll discover how harmony contributes to the emotional depth of music in classical, film scores, and contemporary music.</p>
