            Music theory forms the foundation for all musical understanding. In this section, you'll learn about the core elements of music, including rhythm, melody, harmony, and the basics of musical structure. We will discuss how these elements come together to form the building blocks of songs, symphonies, and everything in between.

            Understanding musical notation is essential for reading and writing music. In this topic, we will cover the various symbols and signs used in music notation, such as notes, rests, time signatures, and key signatures. You will also learn how to interpret these symbols to read sheet music.

            Scales and intervals are fundamental to understanding the relationships between notes in music. You will learn about major and minor scales, how they are constructed, and the role intervals play in creating melodies and harmonies. Understanding these concepts will allow you to compose and analyze music effectively.

            Chords are created by combining multiple notes, and harmony occurs when these chords support the melody. This topic will teach you how to construct chords, understand chord progressions, and analyze harmonic structures. Youâ€™ll also learn how harmony is used to create emotional depth in music.
